- Drop “a”, “an” or “the” at the beginning.
- All links are sorted alphabetically.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link you’re adding.

## Updating your pull request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your pull request before it’s merged. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your pull request didn’t match the list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a pull request, and the different ways you can do that.
